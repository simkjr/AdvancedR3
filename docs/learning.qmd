## Header 1

```{r setup}
library(tidyverse)
library(targets)
tar_config_set(store = here::here("_targets"))
source(here::here("R/functions.R"))
lipidomics <- tar_read(lipidomics)
```

## Making a table

```{r}
```

```{r}
# Use it like this, which should give the same output as before.
create_table_descriptive_stats(lipidomics)
```

## Results: basic stats table

```{r}
tar_read(table_descriptive_stats) |>
  knitr::kable(
    caption = "The mean and standard deviation of metabolites in the lipidomics dataset"
  )
```

## Plot of distributions

```{r}
create_plot_distributions(lipidomics)
```

```{r}
tar_read(plot_distributions)
```

## Preparing the data

```{r}
lipidomics |>
  count(code, metabolite) |>
  filter(n > 1)
```

```{r}
```

```{r}

```

```{r}
clean(lipidomics)
```

## This is poorly formatted

-   Definitely should have an empty space above this list.
-   This isn't a list, why not?
